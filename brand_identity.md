5. Visual Identity

5.1 Premium Color Palette (Luxury Jazz Aesthetic)

Role	Color	Hex	Usage
Primary	Midnight Black	#0a0a0a	Main backgrounds, sophisticated depth.
Secondary	Warm Cream	#faf8f5	Primary text, card backgrounds, clean contrast.
Accent	Warm Brass	#b8860b	Highlights, hover states, premium accents. Evokes jazz instruments.
Support	Deep Charcoal	#2a2a2a	Secondary backgrounds, subtle contrasts.
Trust/CTA	WhatsApp Green	#25D366	Primary booking CTA only.

This palette creates sophisticated restraint and editorial elegance, moving away from bright colors toward the refined aesthetic of premium jazz venues and luxury entertainment.

Contrast meets WCAG AA when used as above (indigo/gold on Ghost White, text on indigo ≥ 4.5:1). Adjust if final UI deviates.

5.2 Premium Typography System (Luxury Editorial)

Role	Font	Weight	Usage

Body Copy	Inter	400–500	Clean, professional sans-serif. Excellent readability.
Accent	Playfair Display	italic	Special emphasis, quotes, featured text.

Typography reflects sophisticated jazz club aesthetic - elegant serif headlines paired with clean sans-serif body text for maximum readability and premium feel. Implemented with next/font/google optimization.
